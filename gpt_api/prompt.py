BASIC_INFO = '''
In this environment, distance 1 indicates 1 meter long. Pose is representated as 7 dimention, [x, y, z, qw, qx, qy, qz].
For a 7-dimensional Pose object, you can use Pose.p to get the [x, y, z] coordinates and Pose.q to get the [qw, qx, qy, qz] quaternion orientation.
All functions which has parameter actor_data, and all of actor_data should be in the actor_data_dic.
In the world coordinate system, the positive directions of the xyz coordinate axes are right, front, and upper respectively, so the direction vectors on the right, front,
and upper sides are [1,0,0], [0,1,0], [0,0,1] respectively. In the same way, we can get the unit vectors of the left side, back side and down side.

# If you know the target point and want to drop an actor to the target point, you typically execute the following code:
# ```python
# # The actor is on the left gripper
# self.left_move_to_pose_with_screw(target_pose)  # left arm move to the target pose
# target_pose[2] -= 0.05  # drop height of actor
# self.left_move_to_pose_with_screw(target_pose)  # left arm move to the drop pose
# self.open_left_gripper()  # open left gripper to place the actor
# target_pose[2] += 0.05  # lift height of actor
# self.left_move_to_pose_with_screw(target_pose)  # left arm move to the lift pose
# # You also can move right arm
# ```

FUNCTION_EXAMPLE = '''
You can retrieve the actor object by the actor's name:
```python
actor = self.actor_name_dic['actor_name']
```
You can retrieve the actor_data object by the actor_data's name:
```python
actor_data = self.actor_data_dic['actor_data_name']
```

Here are some APIs and examples of grasping objects:
If you want to get the gripper pose to grasp the actor, you typically execute the following code:
```python
grasp_pose = self.get_grasp_pose_to_grasp_object(endpose_tag = "left", self.actor, self.actor_data, pre_dis = 0.09)  # endpose_tag can be "left" or "right"
```

If you want to pick up an actor, you can refer to the following sample code:
```python
pre_grasp_pose = self.get_grasp_pose_to_grasp_object(endpose_tag = "left", self.actor, self.actor_data, pre_dis = 0.09)  # endpose_tag can be "left" or "right"
target_grasp_pose = self.get_grasp_pose_to_grasp_object(endpose_tag = "left", self.actor, self.actor_data, pre_dis = 0)  # endpose_tag can be "left" or "right"
self.left_move_to_pose_with_screw(pre_grasp_pose)      # left arm move to the pre grasp pose
self.left_move_to_pose_with_screw(target_grasp_pose)   # left arm move to the grasp pose
self.close_left_gripper()  # close left gripper to grasp the actor
self.left_move_to_pose_with_screw(pre_grasp_pose)      # lift the actor up
```
The code for grasping with the right arm or both arms is similar to the above code.

For the grasping of a certain actor, the movement of the end-effector typically executes the following codes:
```python
actor_pose = self.get_actor_goal_pose(self.actor, self.actor_data)

if actor_pose[0] > 0:           # if the actor in the right side, use right arm to grasp the actor
    # grasp actor with right arm
else:                           # if the actor in the left side, use left arm to grasp the actor
    # grasp actor with left arm
```

Here are some examples of gripper control:
```python
self.close_left_gripper(pos = 0.02)    # Close half of the left gripper
self.close_left_gripper(pos = -0.01)    # Tighten the left gripper.
self.open_left_gripper(pos = 0.02)    # Open half of the left gripper
self.close_right_gripper(pos = 0.02)    # Close half of the right gripper
self.close_right_gripper(pos = -0.01)    # Tighten the right gripper.
self.open_right_gripper(pos = 0.02)    # Open half of the right gripper
self.together_close_gripper(left_pos = 0.02,right_pose = 0.02) # Together close half of grippers
```
Note:
For grabbing some objects, you may need to close the clamping jaws tightly to grab them. You can adjust this through the 'pos' parameter, like 'pos = -0.01'.
By default 'pos' is 0, when close gripper.

Here are some APIs and examples of moving objects:
Note: The drop height of the actor depends on the distance of the actor that was lifted up the previous action.
To move an object to the target point, the 'get_grasp_pose_from_goal_point_and_direction()' is often called first to obtain the target's gripper posture.

If you want to move the point of actor which is grasped by the gripper action to the target point, you typically execute the following code:
```python
pre_grasp_pose = self.get_grasp_pose_from_goal_point_and_direction(self.actor, self.actor_data, endpose_tag = "left", actor_functional_point_id = 0, target_pose, target_approach_direction, pre_dis = 0.09)
target_grasp_pose = self.get_grasp_pose_from_goal_point_and_direction(self.actor, self.actor_data, endpose_tag = "left", actor_functional_point_id = 0, target_pose, target_approach_direction, pre_dis = 0)
self.left_move_to_pose_with_screw(pre_grasp_pose)      # left arm move to the pre grasp pose
self.left_move_to_pose_with_screw(target_grasp_pose)   # left arm move to the grasp pose
self.open_left_gripper()  # open left gripper to place the target object
# You also can move right arm
```
Note:
1. The target_approach_direction is the approach direction which the actor's expected approach direction at the target point.
2. actor_functional_point_id is the index of the functional point of the actor, You can choose based on the given function points information.
3. For the parameter target_approach_direction, you can use self.world_direction_dic['left', 'front_left', 'front', 'fron_right', 'right', 'top_down'].
4. The target pose can be obtained by calling the 'get_actor_goal_pose()' function.

If you also have requirements for the target orientation of the object, you can specify the actor_target_orientation parameter through the direction vector to determine the final orientation of the object:
```python
# the actor target orientation is front, the direction vector is [0,1,0]
# The positive directions of the direction vector xyz axis are right, front, and up respectively.
pre_grasp_pose = self.get_grasp_pose_from_goal_point_and_direction(self.actor, self.actor_data, endpose_tag = "left", actor_functional_point_id = 0, target_pose, actor_target_orientation = [0,1,0], target_approach_direction, pre_dis = 0.09)
target_grasp_pose = self.get_grasp_pose_from_goal_point_and_direction(self.actor, self.actor_data, endpose_tag = "left", actor_functional_point_id = 0, target_pose, actor_target_orientation = [0,1,0], target_approach_direction, pre_dis = 0)
self.left_move_to_pose_with_screw(pre_grasp_pose)      # left arm move to the pre grasp pose
self.left_move_to_pose_with_screw(target_grasp_pose)   # left arm move to the grasp pose
self.open_left_gripper()  # open left gripper to place the target object
```

If you need to align the functional axis of the grabbed object with the functional axis of the target object, you can use the following code:
```python
target_actor_functional_pose = self.get_actor_functional_pose(self.actor, self.actor_data, actor_functional_point_id = 0)
target_actor_point = target_actor_functional_pose[:3]
target_approach_direction = target_actor_functional_pose[3:]
pre_grasp_pose = self.get_grasp_pose_from_goal_point_and_direction(self.actor, self.actor_data, endpose_tag = "left", actor_functional_point_id = 0, target_point = target_actor_point, target_approach_direction = target_approach_direction, pre_dis = 0.09)
target_grasp_pose = self.get_grasp_pose_from_goal_point_and_direction(self.actor, self.actor_data, endpose_tag = "left", actor_functional_point_id = 0, target_point = target_actor_point, target_approach_direction = target_approach_direction, pre_dis = 0)
self.left_move_to_pose_with_screw(pre_grasp_pose)      # left arm move to the pre grasp pose
self.left_move_to_pose_with_screw(target_grasp_pose)   # left arm move to the grasp pose
self.open_left_gripper()  # open left gripper to place the target object
```
Note: 
1. The parameter actor in get_grasp_pose_from_goal_point_and_direction() should be grasp actor, not the target actor.
2. self.world_direction_dic is a dict of different approach directions.
3. This situation usually occurs when hanging objects or performing some delicate operations.
4. actor_functional_point_id is the index of the functional point of the actor, You can choose based on the given function points information.

Some tasks involve simultaneous operations of the left and right arms, which may require calling the collision avoidance function:
There is no need to avoid collision at the end of the task.
If both arms have moved at the same time before, and the next step needs to be to move the left arm first to place the target object, You can first obtain the pose of the right arm that can avoid subsequent collisions, and then move both arms at the same time:
```python
# Get left and right arm target pose
# Here, the direction in which the object contacts the target point is vertically top_down as an example.
# The actor target orientation is left, the direction vector is [-1,0,0].
left_pre_pose = self.get_grasp_pose_from_goal_point_and_direction(left_actor, left_actor_data, endpose_tag="left", actor_functional_point_id = 0, target_point=point1, target_approach_direction=self.world_direction_dic['top_down'], 
                                                                        actor_target_orientation=[-1, 0, 0], pre_dis=0.05)
left_target_pose = self.get_grasp_pose_from_goal_point_and_direction(left_actor, left_actor_data, endpose_tag="left", actor_functional_point_id = 0, target_point=point1, target_approach_direction=self.world_direction_dic['top_down'], 
                                                                        actor_target_orientation=[-1, 0, 0], pre_dis=0)
right_pre_pose = self.get_grasp_pose_from_goal_point_and_direction(right_actor, right_actor_data, endpose_tag="right", actor_functional_point_id = 0, target_point=point2, target_approach_direction=self.world_direction_dic['top_down'], 
                                                                        actor_target_orientation=[-1, 0, 0], pre_dis=0.05)
right_target_pose = self.get_grasp_pose_from_goal_point_and_direction(right_actor, right_actor_data, endpose_tag="right", actor_functional_point_id = 0, target_point=point2, target_approach_direction=self.world_direction_dic['top_down'], 
                                                                        actor_target_orientation=[-1, 0, 0], pre_dis=0)
# right arm avoid collision pose
right_avoid_collision_pose = self.get_avoid_collision_pose(avoid_collision_arm_tag = 'right')
# move left arm to the pre pose and right arm to the avoid collision pose
self.together_move_to_pose_with_screw(left_pre_pose, right_avoid_collision_pose)
# put down the actor on left gripper
self.left_move_to_pose_with_screw(left_target_pose)
self.open_left_gripper()  # open left gripper to place the target object
# left arm avoid collision pose
left_avoid_collision_pose = self.get_avoid_collision_pose(avoid_collision_arm_tag = 'left')
# move right arm to the target pose and left arm to the avoid collision pose
self.together_move_to_pose_with_screw(left_avoid_collision_pose, right_pre_pose)
# put down the actor on right gripper
self.right_move_to_pose_with_screw(right_target_pose)
self.open_right_gripper()  # open right gripper to place the target object
# avoid_collision_arm_tag: 'left' or 'right'
# direction: 'left', 'right', 'front', 'back', 'up', 'down'
```
Note: 
1. If the move_arm_tag is 'left', the direction also not be 'right', and same for 'right'.
2. Collision avoidance may only be necessary if both arms have been moved.
